        So often we find that clients want their home to be beautiful and
        functional, but they aren’t exactly sure how to make that happen.
        Phinney Home Interiors will come alongside you to help you figure out
        how to make your space work for you and your family.

        Being based in Seattle, we know that many people feel like they are
        outgrowing their home, but it’s not financially possible to buy a bigger
        house. We love to create space where you feel like there isn’t any by
        adding the extra storage you need or squeezing a home office into your
        space. We want you to love the home that you are in!
      </p>
      <p class="description-body">
        Phinney Home Interiors would love to help you with your next project,
        whether that is picking a paint color for your bedroom, planning your
        new kitchen, selecting new furniture or accessories for your home, or
        simply helping you brainstorm better ways to use your space, we are
        happy to help! We want to help you find your style, organize your home
        and give you a place that you are happy to come home to each evening.
